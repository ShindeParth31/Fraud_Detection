 Project Overview
 Fraud detection involves identifying suspicious or fraudulent activities within transactional data
 using machine learning techniques. This project classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitimate
 and is implemented in Google Colab with support for custom datasets.

 Objectives- Detect fraudulent transactions- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering- Handle imbalanced datasets- Evaluate model performance- Build a scalable fraud detection system
 Dataset
 User-provided CSV dataset containing transaction data with a binary target column (0 = Legitimate,
 1 = Fraud).

 Models Used- Logistic Regression- Random Forest Classifier- SMOTE (optional)

 Technologies
 Python, Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn
